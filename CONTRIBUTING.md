## Useful contributions

### Features
It's a one-man team here, and I need help with some of the translations. I don't know ASM extremely well, I'm currently learning it, so if anyone could help with that that would be awesome :)

### Bug fixes
I overlook a lot of bugs, please fix them if you come by them

## Do not

Fix typos. I can do that myself
